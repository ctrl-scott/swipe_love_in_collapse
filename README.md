MUD concept 

Additional ideas

+You can include statistics for travel, transient population based off time of year, gender information, historical data, historical cdc data up to 2005 (prior to MySpace). While it sounds dated and tired you can take the data and then evolve into our present day - I am not a mathematician and there are people out there that can work magic with numbers in a much more beautiful way than I ever could or probably be able to in this lifetime \
+Some base points are that the mileage is the size of Alabama and the population is 5,000,000\
+You would have to account for people under 21 in Alabama now (with the margin of error or margin of dishonesty in computing (per the legislation)\
+You would have to account for motor and air travel in and out of the state\
+You would have to account for reporting and include a margin of error due to missed appointments, deaths, misdiagnosis, crime mislabeling, corruption\

+For example, to quantify corruption, you would have to include the historical data, financial data, actual charges levied, determine the scope of examination - to further complicate matters, you would have quantify ethical handling and mishandling (or margin of error(s))\

+The goal of this concept is to orient people to the world as it is today with social media - because of the hybrid reality we form. (Again, in my own case, leave the internet on the internet)\
